## Description
I have always been intrigued by sprirographs - I distinctly remember drawing every single shape I could with them as a 7 year old and assigning themse shapes unique names and personalities. Many years later, I have come to appreciate the math behind these beautiful patterns. Rose mathematics will never fail to intrigue me.
